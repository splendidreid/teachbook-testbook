The website [A TeachBook TestBook](https://splendidreid.github.io/teachbook-testbook/main/intro.html) is created using the [TeachBooks Python package](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks). To recreate it you have two options (more information in the [TeachBooks manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/):
- In the GitHub interface: fork this repository, enable Github Pages from the source GitHub actions (Settings - Code and automation - Pages - Build and deployment - Source - GitHub Actions), enable workflows (Actions - I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them) and run the call-deploy-book workflow (Actions - call-deploy-book - Run workflow - Run workflow). The website is released on the URL as shown on the workflow summary when the workflow has finished (Actions - call-deploy-book - call-deploy-book - Summary).
- On your own computer: clone this repository, install the required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and build the book (`teachbooks build book`). The website is stored locally in `book/_build/index.html`.
